    Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.
    
    I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
    There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
    even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.
    
    Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
    only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.
    
    If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
    Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, social media), I
    built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and all
    of the puzzles.
    
    The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
    puzzles each year takes all of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort
    went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
    enjoyed making it for you!
    
    If you'd like to hang out, I'm @was.tl on Bluesky, @ericwastl@hachyderm.io on
    Mastodon, and @ericwastl on Twitter.

            <h2>--- Day 4: Ceres Search ---</h2>
            <p>"Looks like the Chief's not here. Next!" One of The Historians pulls out a device and pushes the only
                button on it. After a brief flash, you recognize the interior of the <a href="/2019/day/10">Ceres
                    monitoring station</a>!</p>
            <p>As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd
                like to know if you could help her with her <em>word search</em> (your puzzle input). She only has to
                find one word: <code>XMAS</code>.</p>
            <p>This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even
                overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of
                <code>XMAS</code> - you need to find <em>all of them</em>. Here are a few ways <code>XMAS</code> might
                appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with <code>.</code>:</p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <pre><code>..X...
.SAMX.
.A..A.
XMAS.S
.X....
</code></pre>
            <p>The actual word search will be full of letters instead. For example:</p>
            <pre><code>MMMSXXMASM
MSAMXMSMSA
AMXSXMAAMM
MSAMASMSMX
XMASAMXAMM
XXAMMXXAMA
SMSMSASXSS
SAXAMASAAA
MAMMMXMMMM
MXMXAXMASX
</code></pre>
            <p>In this word search, <code>XMAS</code> occurs a total of <code><em>18</em></code> times; here's the same
                word search again, but where letters not involved in any <code>XMAS</code> have been replaced with
                <code>.</code>:</p>
            <pre><code>....XXMAS.
.SAMXMS...
...S..A...
..A.A.MS.X
XMASAMX.MM
X.....XA.A
S.S.S.S.SS
.A.A.A.A.A
..M.M.M.MM
.X.X.XMASX
</code></pre>
            <p>Take a look at the little Elf's word search. <em>How many times does <code>XMAS</code> appear?</em></p>
