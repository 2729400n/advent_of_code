            This looks like a job for regex

            <p>The solution for this is a lot mor invloved we shall implement a matrix 
                search algorithm a for of emmit search. this shall be bounded to the origin and move only linearly.
                another solution I imagined was a rotation based solution with the angles 45<sup>o</sup> and 90<sup>o</sup>  howver the memory management is too much complexity for the given problem
