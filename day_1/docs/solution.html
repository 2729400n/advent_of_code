            We have an endpoint called <code>&lt;base&gt;</code>1/input. 
            which we shall use to recieve input. This is a web based challenge seems like we wont need to deal
            with raw sockets or special non standard protocols. Using nodejs would be the pragmatic choice. Nodejs will help
            abstract the fetching and sending of data. on the topic of sending data there is another enpoint for sending the solution.
            using Nodejs is also favourable here. For solving the challenge it may be better to use python so i thought of using pipes but it takes to much time.
            It does offer speed benefits so i will after this write a python writeup to handle request and the likes.
