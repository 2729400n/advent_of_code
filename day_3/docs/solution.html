            This looks like a job for regex
                
            <h1 id="solution">Solving the challenge</h1>
            <h3 id="solution-part-1">Part1</h3>
            <p>The solution to this is quite simple so I will employ a regex as i have been using nodejs I shall continue to use that.
                The challenge has specifically asks specifically for mul(&lt;x&gt;, &lt;y&gt;). 
                we can use two regex properties regex strings and capture groups as well as match lists.
                
                The regex i wil use is <code style="color: red;">/mul\((\d{1,3}),(\d{1,3})\)/g</code>

                using regex matchAll will give us the regexes that match then we just use the capture groups associated and then Integer parse then mul.    

            </p>
            <h3 id="solution-part-2">Part2</h3>
            <p>For this one we keep the regex mostly the same but add an or to allow for matching any allowed expression
                <code style="color: red;">/(?<=.*)mul\((\d{1,3}),(\d{1,3})\)(?=.*)|don't\(\)|do\(\)/g</code> 

            </p>
