    Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.
    
    I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
    There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
    even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.
    
    Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
    only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.
    
    If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
    Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, social media), I
    built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and all
    of the puzzles.
    
    The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
    puzzles each year takes all of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort
    went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
    enjoyed making it for you!
    
    If you'd like to hang out, I'm @was.tl on Bluesky, @ericwastl@hachyderm.io on
    Mastodon, and @ericwastl on Twitter.

            <h2>--- Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports ---</h2>
            <p>Fortunately, the first location The Historians want to search isn't a long walk from the Chief
                Historian's office.</p>
            <p>While the <a href="/2015/day/19">Red-Nosed Reindeer nuclear fusion/fission plant</a> appears to contain
                no sign of the Chief Historian, the engineers there run up to you as soon as they see you. Apparently,
                they <em>still</em> talk about the time Rudolph was saved through molecular synthesis from a single
                electron.</p>
            <p>They're quick to add that - since you're already here - they'd really appreciate your help analyzing some
                unusual data from the Red-Nosed reactor. You turn to check if The Historians are waiting for you, but
                they seem to have already divided into groups that are currently searching every corner of the facility.
                You offer to help with the unusual data.</p>
            <p>The unusual data (your puzzle input) consists of many <em>reports</em>, one report per line. Each report
                is a list of numbers called <em>levels</em> that are separated by spaces. For example:</p>
<pre><code>7 6 4 2 1
1 2 7 8 9
9 7 6 2 1
1 3 2 4 5
8 6 4 4 1
1 3 6 7 9</code></pre>
            <p>This example data contains six reports each containing five levels.</p>
            <p>The engineers are trying to figure out which reports are <em>safe</em>. The Red-Nosed reactor safety
                systems can only tolerate levels that are either gradually increasing or gradually decreasing. So, a
                report only counts as safe if both of the following are true:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The levels are either <em>all increasing</em> or <em>all decreasing</em>.</li>
                <li>Any two adjacent levels differ by <em>at least one</em> and <em>at most three</em>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the example above, the reports can be found safe or unsafe by checking those rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>7 6 4 2 1</code>: <em>Safe</em> because the levels are all decreasing by 1 or 2.</li>
                <li><code>1 2 7 8 9</code>: <em>Unsafe</em> because <code>2 7</code> is an increase of 5.</li>
                <li><code>9 7 6 2 1</code>: <em>Unsafe</em> because <code>6 2</code> is a decrease of 4.</li>
                <li><code>1 3 2 4 5</code>: <em>Unsafe</em> because <code>1 3</code> is increasing but <code>3 2</code>
                    is decreasing.</li>
                <li><code>8 6 4 4 1</code>: <em>Unsafe</em> because <code>4 4</code> is neither an increase or a
                    decrease.</li>
                <li><code>1 3 6 7 9</code>: <em>Safe</em> because the levels are all increasing by 1, 2, or 3.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So, in this example, <code><em>2</em></code> reports are <em>safe</em>.</p>
            <p>Analyze the unusual data from the engineers. <em>How many reports are safe?</em></p>
